# CompressDependency

Package dependency modules into a single .ps1 and reinflate them like a self-extracting zip!

## Deduplicate your code!

Many users of legacy systems need to package Powershell code as a single .ps1 file.

These .ps1 files can get large and unwieldy. Being constrained in this way prevents the authors from packaging common code into modules, with all the beneifts that brings.

Use CompressDependency to develop modular code and then stream it to legacy systems as a single .ps1.
